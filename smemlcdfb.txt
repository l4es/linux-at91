Sharp Memory LCD Linux Framebuffer Driver

Required properties:
  - compatible: It should be "sharp,<model-no>". The supported displays are 
         ls027b7dh01, ls044q7dh01, ls013b7dh05, ls013b7dh03. Maybe other 
         monochromatic models can be supported with the current code.
  - reg: SPI chip select number for the device.
  - spi-max-frequency: Max SPI frequency to use. One must verify the datasheet.
  - spi-cs-high: Sharp Memory LCD needs chipselect high.

Optional properties:
  - sharp,frames-per-sec: It should contain the desired frames per second.
         It does not represent the actual frame rate. Default: 10
  - sharp,extmode-high: External COM Input signal is expected in EXTCOMIN port.
         This is recommended to reduce CPU and SPI Load.
  - pwm: If property "sharp,extmode-high" is specified, this is recommended.
         It should contain the pwm to use, according to
         Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
         Verify the display datasheet for the EXTCOMIN signal period
  - disp-gpios: The GPIO used to enable the display, if available. See
                 Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt for details.

Examples:

ls027b7dh01: smemlcd@0 {
        compatible = "sharp,ls027b7dh01";
        reg = <0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
        spi-cs-high;
        disp-gpios = <&gpio0 7>;
        disp-active-high;
        sharp,extmode-high;
        pwms = <&pwm 0 100000000>;
};

ls013b7dh05: smemlcd@3 {
        compatible = "sharp,ls013b7dh05";
        reg = <3>;
        spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
        spi-cs-high;
        disp-gpios = <&gpio0 13>;
        disp-active-high;
        sharp,extmode-high;
        pwms = <&pwm 0 50000000>;
        sharp,frames-per-sec = <20>;
};
